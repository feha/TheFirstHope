# TheFirstHope
A shitty game(?) to hopefully be used in watch+play or walking simulator.
No actual vision for it yet, besides it slowly morphing into desert bus.
Even better if its BEAR-sert bus. With a bear player-model. HAH! Jokes...

Must have the actual worst ladder in a game.
One that is decorative, but you can slowly jump up one pin at a time.


Let's begin planning!

- Loads of walking. At least 15 minutes, maybe more than 1 hour.
- bear-model with wheels driving on a road in the desert in the end
- game ends when you drive offroad.
  - Possible other way to end?
- end manifests in... ?
  - loading random new level?
- Sub-Ocean!
